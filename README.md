# Directorate Connectedness and Firm Performance: The Case of New York City, 1902--1912

## 1 About

This directory contains a TeX file which, when compiled into a PDF, forms the paper **Directorate Connectedness and Firm Performance: The Case of New York City, 1902--1912**. The paper investigates the connectedness of corporate directors in New York City and their firms' performance.

### 1.1 Abstract

This article uses network theory to investigate the topological structure of the New York City directorate network. We quote the abstract of the article below.

> We project a dataset of New York City directors from 1902â€“1912 as a network of social relations and firm interlocks. This network is coupled with firm performance metrics to investigate whether a more connected directorate enjoys an improved robustness to economic shocks and better profitability.

### 1.2 Data

The sources of data used in the article are referenced in the paper. In short:

- The directorate network was constructed from the New York City Directory of Directors, which were published each year from 1902 to 1912.
- Firm valuation was collected from the [New York Times TimesMachine](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser).
- Bank valuation was collected from the Annual Report of the Superintendent of Banks for each year between 1902 to 1912.
- Supplementary data on the assets and liabilities of financial institutions was collected from the Annual Report of the
Comptroller of the Currency for each year between 1902 to 1912.
